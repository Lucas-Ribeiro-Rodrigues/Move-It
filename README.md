# Move-it

Move it is a React-typescript project made for studying the technologies and their features, especially the React context API, which was the newer one for me.

The idea is to create a web page that gamifies healthy exercises for people with sedentary jobs (like programmers), the user would receive a new "challenge" after every 25 minutes, which consists in healthy practices, like stretching, closing the eyes for 2 minutes, and so on.
